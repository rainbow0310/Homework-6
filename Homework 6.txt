2. a) What is a particle system in Unity? Explain any scenario where particle systems may be useful (you can create your own scenarios or point to existing games that youâ€™re familiar with).

	A particle system is used to create visual effects by simulating particles like smoke, fire, sparks, explosions, or rain. It enhances the realism and dynamics of the game environment. A particle system can be useful when creating a physical representation of gunfire. Moreover, when a gun fires, a muzzle flash effect can be created using a particle system. This system would emit particles representing sparks and fire, making the gun firing animation look more realistic and impactful.

 a) Explain the terms animation controller, animation, and transition in Unity (be sure elaborate on the exit time and condition transition criteria) 
	Animation Controller: decides which animations a GameObject should perform and when. It represents a state machine, managing the flow between different animation states.

	Animation: the specific motion that a game object experiences while in a specific state. It is the individual actions that a GameObject can perform, such as walking, running, jumping, or attacking. They define the movement and appearance of the GameObject over time.

	Transition: refers to the movement from one state to another based on a condition or exit time. For example, a transition might control how smoothly a character shifts from walking to running.

		Exit Time: a property that defines that time after which a transition from one state to another should take place regardless of any other factor within the game. Moreover, it defines how long a GameObject should stay in a particular animation state before automatically transitioning to another state. For example, you might set the exit time for an idle animation to 5 seconds, meaning that after 5 seconds of standing still, the avatar will automatically start walking. 

		Conditions: instead of relying only on time, a condition-based transition occurs only when a specific requirement is met. These conditions are typically defined using triggers or Boolean variables and are more stringent in nature. For instance, in the zombie game, the zombie transitions from a walking state to an attacking state only when the player comes within a certain range.
